# Global Catalog
- The global catalog is a feature of Active Directory (AD) that allows a domain controller (DC) to provide information on any object in the forest, regardless of whether the object is a member of its domain. Domain controllers with the global catalog feature enabled are referred to as **global catalog servers.**
- The Global Catalog stores a partial list of attributes for domains in the forest.
- Supports queries for resources in other domains in the forest.

## Configuring Global Catalog
- When a new domain is created, the first DC will be made a global catalog server. To configure additional DCs as global catalog servers, either enable the Global Catalog checkbox in the serverâ€™s NTDS Settings properties in the Active Directory Sites and Services management console, or use the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```ps1
Set-ADObject -Identity (Get-ADDomainController -Server <SERVER>).NTDSSettingsObjectDN -Replace @{options='1'} 
```
